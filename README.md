This project will build new datasets or share tools used to integrate PWS facility information found here: https://data.ca.gov/dataset/drinking-water-public-water-system-information
with source data.

Some of our Public Water Systems (about 300 out of the 7500?) completed a stress test a few years ago and provided some detailed information as a result of that effort. 

The stress test submittals, as received, are posted with self-certification material; the pinpoint link to compiled submittals is here: https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/conservation_portal/docs/emergency_reg/uw_self-cert_submittals.xlsx  

If you go into that worksheet and find Column X you see a clickable link the field: click on Column X link and get something like thisâ€¦

SFPUC is a wholesaler, so someone may have to figure out some other way where thie wholesaler gets their water from. Looking up the wholesaler ID in SDWIS reveals this: https://sdwis.waterboards.ca.gov/PDWW/JSP/WaterSystemDetail.jsp?tinwsys_is_number=13798&tinwsys_st_code=CA&wsnumber=CA3810008

The self-certification material section contains a link to a PDF Wholesale Urban Water Supplier Web Addresses that points to the information wholesalers submitted to us under the emergency regulation.  Hopefully this is what you are looking for.  For instance, Zone 7 information should be here: http://www.zone7water.com/index.php/conservation-rebates/water-conservation/36-public/content/203-drought 

The wholesaler files may have been posted on the DRINC portal before transition from the DDN platform; we asked all those files to be ported over to the new .net platform.  Unfortunately, there may still be some links that point to DNN files.

Here is the raw PWS facility info to be integrated with source data/information: https://data.ca.gov/dataset/drinking-water-public-water-system-information/resource/0f7743e9-2777-4bbe-a3d4-fe4c9a704c18#{view-graph:{graphOptions:{hooks:{processOffset:{},bindEvents:{}}}},graphOptions:{hooks:{processOffset:{},bindEvents:{}}}}

Creating resilience for urban water supply systems requires innovative thematic visualizations of the interface between infrastructure, ecology, and culture to viscerally engage lay audiences in the policy making process. Sankey maps (a hybrid Sankey diagram/flow map) embed the systemic accounting ...
