This project will build new datasets or share tools used to integrate PWS facility information found here: https://data.ca.gov/dataset/drinking-water-public-water-system-information
with source data.

Some of our Public Water Systems (about 300 out of the 7500?) completed a stress test a few years ago and provided some detailed information as a result of that effort. 

The stress test submittals, as received, are posted with self-certification material; the pinpoint link to compiled submittals is here: https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/conservation_portal/docs/emergency_reg/uw_self-cert_submittals.xlsx  

If you go into that worksheet and find Column X you see a clickable link the field: click on Column X link and get something like thisâ€¦

Creating resilience for urban water supply systems requires innovative thematic visualizations of the interface between infrastructure, ecology, and culture to viscerally engage lay audiences in the policy making process. Sankey maps (a hybrid Sankey diagram/flow map) embed the systemic accounting ...
